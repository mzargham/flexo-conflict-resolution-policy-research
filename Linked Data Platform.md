# Linked Data Platform

[W3C standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/) for reading and writing [[RDF]] resources over HTTP using REST patterns. Defines containers (collections of resources) and interaction models for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting linked data resources.

## In Flexo MMS

Listed as one of the web-compatible standards adopted at every Flexo interface ([Architecture](https://openmbee.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OPENMBEE/pages/320765953/Flexo-MMS+Architecture)). LDP provides the RESTful interaction model for managing RDF resources — complementing [[SPARQL]] (for queries) and [[Graph Store Protocol]] (for whole-graph operations) with resource-level CRUD.
