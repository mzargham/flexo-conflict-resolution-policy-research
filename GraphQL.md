# GraphQL

Query language for APIs (originally from Facebook) that lets clients specify the exact shape of the response they need, avoiding over- and under-fetching. Maintained as an open standard under the [GraphQL Foundation](https://graphql.org/) (Linux Foundation); the specification is published at [spec.graphql.org](https://spec.graphql.org/).

## In Flexo MMS

Listed among the web-compatible standards adopted for data exchange at Flexo interfaces ([Architecture](https://openmbee.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OPENMBEE/pages/320765953/Flexo-MMS+Architecture)). Complements [[SPARQL]] by offering a more familiar query interface for frontend and integration tooling that doesn't need full RDF query capabilities.
