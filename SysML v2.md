# SysML v2

[OMG standard](https://www.omg.org/sysml/sysmlv2/) for systems modeling — the successor to SysML v1, with a formal [API specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/SystemsModelingAPI/) for tool interoperability.

## In Flexo MMS

The [flexo-mms-sysmlv2](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/flexo-mms-sysmlv2) service implements the OMG SysML v2 API Services Specification as a platform-specific model (PSM) layer on top of Flexo Layer 1. It was generated from the [official OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-API-Services).

This service provides the project/commit/element/branch/tag/merge/diff/query API surface used at the [[Flexo Individual Contributor Level]].

Standards compliance with the OMG SysML v2 API enables tool interoperability across organizational boundaries — any compliant client can work with a Flexo backend ([[Flexo Ecosystem Level]]).
