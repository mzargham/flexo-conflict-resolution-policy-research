# OSLC

Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration — an [OASIS open project](https://open-services.net/) defining [specifications](https://open-services.net/specifications/) for integrating tools across the engineering lifecycle (requirements, design, test, change management).

## In Flexo MMS

OSLC serves two roles in the Flexo ecosystem ([Architecture](https://openmbee.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OPENMBEE/pages/320765953/Flexo-MMS+Architecture)):

1. **Cross-organization asset sharing** — when organizations run separate Flexo deployments, OSLC linking enables cross-tool traceability without tight coupling or data duplication
2. **Standards interoperability** — listed as a core web-compatible standard adopted at Flexo interfaces, alongside [[SPARQL]], [[Graph Store Protocol]], [[Linked Data Platform]], [[GraphQL]], and [[SysML v2]]
