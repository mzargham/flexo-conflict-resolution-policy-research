# Flexo Organization Level

**Concern:** IT/platform team maintaining Flexo for the enterprise.

## Flexo Hierarchy

```
Deployment (Cluster)
└── Org(s)                    ← Administrative boundary
    └── Repo(s)               ← Version-controlled container
        └── Collection(s)     ← Logical grouping of model content
            └── Branch(es)    ← Mutable ref to commit lineage
            └── Tag(s)        ← Immutable ref to specific commit
            └── Lock(s)       ← Snapshot materialization control
```

Flexo-MMS exposes CRUD endpoints for management of [[RDF]] graphs (creating Orgs, Repos, Branches, etc.) ([Architecture](https://openmbee.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OPENMBEE/pages/320765953/Flexo-MMS+Architecture)). See also the [Layer 1 OpenAPI spec](https://www.openmbee.org/flexo-mms-layer1-openapi/).

## Key Entities

| Entity         | Description                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Org**        | Administrative container for access control and governance. Maps to organizational units (business units, programs, divisions). |
| **Repo**       | A version-controlled container for related model content.                                                                       |
| **Collection** | Logical partitioning within a repo (e.g., by subsystem, by discipline).                                                         |

Partitions delimit responsibility for model assets but do not imply an absence of inter-collection dependencies.

## Identity Scheme

Every entity in the Flexo hierarchy has a URI-based identity. The mutability column indicates whether the entity's *content* can change after creation (the URI itself is always stable).

| Entity | URI Pattern | Mutability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Org | `<base>/orgs/{orgId}` | Mutable metadata |
| Repo | `<base>/orgs/{orgId}/repos/{repoId}` | Mutable metadata |
| Branch | `<base>/.../branches/{branchId}` | Mutable (advances to new commits) |
| Commit | `<base>/.../commits/{commitId}` | Immutable |
| Lock | `<base>/.../locks/{lockId}` | Immutable (points to fixed commit) |
| Tag | `<base>/.../tags/{tagId}` | Immutable |
| Element | `urn:uuid:{elementId}` | Immutable within a commit |

## Deployment Infrastructure

The Layer 1 service requires a [[SPARQL]] 1.1 compliant [[quadstore]] as a backend. The reference stack uses [[Apache Jena Fuseki]], which binds locally on port 3030 ([flexo-mms-layer1-service](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/flexo-mms-layer1-service)).

Complementary services include an [auth service](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/flexo-mms-auth-service) for LDAP-based authentication and a [store service](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/flexo-mms-store-service) for large RDF data uploads to S3-compliant storage.

Flexo MMS stores all of its state information in the quadstore alongside user data ([flexo-mms-layer1-service](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/flexo-mms-layer1-service)).

Deployment examples (Docker Compose and k8s) are available in the [flexo-mms-deployment](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/flexo-mms-deployment) repo.

## IT Operations Responsibilities

- Quadstore provisioning and backup
- Cluster initialization with deployment-specific configuration (see [deployment guide](https://flexo-mms-deployment-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flexo-mms-layer1-service/index.html))
- Access control policy configuration
- Performance tuning (snapshot retention, query optimization, read/write endpoint separation)
